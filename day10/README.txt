If anyone wants to know how I did part two...

First, I wrote code to draw a diagram of only the main loop to output.txt
Then, I copied the contents of output.txt to a pageless format Google doc with 0.55 line spacing (see images/google_doc.png)
Then, I screenshotted the doc into paint and messed with the bucket tool until I got final_paint_image.png
I counted the little dots twice, getting one too low the first time and one too high the second time.
Miraculously, I was able to guess the answer after that without counting again.

I apologize for telling you that. Enjoy the rest of your life.
